Mehtods and field definitions are infact wrapped into traits. These can be reused by extending them into classes.
Unlike inheritance, a class can extend any no.of traits.

To aovid confusion and for people who are trying hard to makeout what trait meand and how it could be used in class,
trait can very well compared to abstract classes in Java.

Definition of trait:
trait Equal {
  def isEqual(x: Any): Boolean
  def isNotEqual(x: Any): Boolean = !isEqual(x)
}

In the above trait definition, the method isEqual has no implementation whereas the method !isNotEqual has its implementation.
The classes which extend a trait can give implementation for the un-implemented methods like isEqual.

Example of a class extending a trait:

trait Equal {
  def isEqual(x: Any): Boolean
  def isNotEqual(x: Any): Boolean = !isEqual(x)
}

class Point(xc: Int, yc: Int) extends Equal {
  var x: Int = xc
  var y: Int = yc
  
  // Implementation isEqual method
  def isEqual(obj: Any) =
    obj.isInstanceOf[Point] &&
    obj.asInstanceOf[Point].x == x
}

Use traits-
1. If certain behavior has to be reused in multiple classes than make it a trait.
